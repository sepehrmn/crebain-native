# Contributing to CREBAIN

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CREBAIN! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.81+ with `cargo`
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (for CoreML/Metal)
- **Linux**: CUDA Toolkit (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/crebain/crebain.git
cd crebain

# Build and run
cargo run --release

# Or use Nix
nix develop
cargo run --release
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and linting
5. Submit a pull request

### Code Quality Requirements

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

```bash
cargo check --workspace          # Type check all crates
cargo clippy --workspace         # Lint all crates
cargo test --workspace           # All tests pass
```

### Code Style

- Run `cargo clippy` before committing
- Use `log::info/warn/error` instead of `println!`
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use `spawn_blocking` for CPU-intensive operations in async contexts
- Use functional components with Bevy ECS (systems, resources, events)
- Derive `Resource` for app state, `Component` for entity data

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

feat(fusion): add particle filter support
fix(ros): handle disconnection gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all checks pass
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Address feedback promptly

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs or screenshots

## Feature Requests

Open an issue with:

- Clear description of the feature
